# Changelog

All notable changes to **VirtFoundry** (API, UI) are documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://github.com/virtfoundry/helm-charts/blob/main/docs/project/versioning.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Dashboard:** the `/dashboard` page now surfaces Kubernetes host telemetry (node count, ready nodes, allocatable CPU and memory, distinct kubelet versions and OS image) sourced from `core/v1/nodes` via the `KubeVirtDriver`. The new `GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary` field `hosts` is additive; older clients keep working. The section renders a disabled state when the cluster is unreachable (Forbidden, RBAC, no kubeconfig) so the endpoint never 500s. Tier 1 only — no new dependency.

### Changed

- **UI:** the dashboard host section is now titled "Cluster nodes" (was "Cluster host"), and the OS label is "OS image" / "Imagem do SO" (was "OS" / "SO"). The data is `Node.Status.NodeInfo.OSImage` from `core/v1/nodes` — i.e. the OS of the cluster nodes that run the workloads, **not** the OS of the developer's machine. In `kind` the value is the kind node image (Debian trixie); in kubeadm on bare metal it is the host OS (e.g. AlmaLinux); in AKS/EKS it is the managed node image (Ubuntu / Amazon Linux). No backend changes, no contract change.
- **UI:** dashboard capacity labels now read "Allocatable CPU (cluster)" / "Allocatable memory (cluster)" (PT: "CPU alocável (cluster)" / "Memória alocável (cluster)"). The values are the **sum of `Status.Allocatable` across all nodes** — they grow with the node count, not with a single host.

### Changed

- **UI:** the "(cluster)" suffix on the CPU and Memory capacity labels was making the cards overflow and break into a second line when the sidebar is expanded. Reverted the labels to "Allocatable CPU" / "Allocatable memory" and moved the aggregation hint to a `title` tooltip on the card. The section title "Cluster nodes" already conveys the scope.
- **UI:** the "Ready nodes" card now shows a small status badge in the top-right corner that summarises cluster node health at a glance: green "All ready" when every node is Ready, yellow "N degraded" when some are not, red "None ready" when zero are. The badge reuses the same colour tokens as the dashboard "Health" card. No new card, no new data — it just lifts `nodes` / `nodes_ready` from the existing payload.

### Added

- **Dashboard:** the stats row now includes a **Storage** card that aggregates tenant-scoped PVCs: `used / total` (auto-scaled to B/KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB), the percentage of used capacity, and the PVC count. New `GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary` field `storage` (additive). Backend reuses the existing PVC list path in `KubeVirtDriver`; empty store, memory mode, and Forbidden degrade gracefully.

### Added

- **Dashboard:** the Cluster nodes section now includes a **Cluster addons** strip with one coloured dot per critical dependency: KubeVirt, CDI, Multus, metrics-server, networking. Statuses: green (installed and reachable), grey (absent — CRD/API not registered), yellow (unreachable — Forbidden or transient failure). New `GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary` field `addons` (additive) with a 30s in-memory cache. Discovery calls are not AST-scanned by `rbac_contract_test.go` and so do not require a contract entry. Memory mode and nil client render every dot as yellow.

### Changed

- **API:** the addons probe is now **dynamic** — `KubeVirtDriver.probeAddons` lists every `CustomResourceDefinition` and groups by the `app.kubernetes.io/name` label (the standard Helm/Kustomize convention). The hard-coded list (kubevirt, cdi, multus, metrics-server, networking, cert-manager) is gone; any chart that follows the convention appears automatically. Status is `ok` when at least one CRD with the same name has the `Established=True` condition, `degraded` otherwise. CRDs without the label are ignored. The UI keeps the i18n map for the well-known names and falls back to the raw `app.kubernetes.io/name` value for everything else.

### Added (backend — UI integration pending)

- **API:** `GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary` now includes a new optional `hosts.usage` field with cluster-wide `cpu_usage_millicores` and `memory_usage_bytes` aggregated from `metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes` (served by `metrics-server`). Backend reads via the discovery REST client, caches the result for 30s, and tolerates the API being absent (404), Forbidden (403), or transiently unavailable (5xx, timeout) — the field is omitted and the dashboard renders a degraded state. The chart still has to grant `metrics.k8s.io/nodes` get/list in the API ClusterRole (entry listed under `dynamicClient` in `docs/rbac-contract.yaml`); `metrics-server` is a documented prerequisite. The UI is unchanged in this slice; Tier 1 cards keep their current look.

### Added (UI — Tier 2 cards)

- **UI:** the Cluster nodes section now renders usage bars in the CPU and Memory cards whenever the backend reports `hosts.usage`. Each bar shows `used / allocatable` and a percentage with a colour ramp: `< 60%` primary, `60–85%` warning, `≥ 85%` error. When `metrics-server` is absent the cards show "metrics-server unavailable" / "metrics-server indisponível" instead of the bar — the endpoint still answers, the dashboard stays usable. PT/EN i18n parity checked by `i18n.test.ts`.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- **VKS:** creating a cluster with `network_ref` set to the network display name (for example `default`) made the worker Instances fail with `network "default" not found`. The API now resolves the name to the Network CR (`default-default`); an unknown or ambiguous name returns 400 ([#249](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/249)).
- **UI proxy:** the bundled nginx kept the port out of the `Host` header, so the console WebSocket failed the origin check (403) when the UI was served on a non-default port ([#246](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/pull/246)).

### Added

- `GET /api/v1/healthz` (and `/health`) for load balancer and install checks ([#248](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/pull/248)).

## [0.11.2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- **UI:** the login page showed made-up figures (99.9% SLA, 10K+ managed VMs, 24/7 support). It now shows verifiable facts: Apache 2.0, KubeVirt, CRDs ([#239](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/239)).
- **UI:** the four "Copy ssh" buttons (deploy wizard, VM detail, VM list) did nothing on a page served over plain HTTP, because `navigator.clipboard` does not exist there. They use the clipboard fallback and show Copied only when the copy worked ([#242](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/242)).

## [0.11.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- **API:** a deploy without `template_id` under operator reconcile answers `400` instead of `201` followed by a failed Instance ([#229](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/229)).
- **API:** the VM snapshot list keeps `phase` and `vm_name`; the CR round-trip no longer blanks them ([#230](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/230)).
- **API:** the SSH key fingerprint is derived from the public key when the CR has none, also for existing keys ([#231](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/231)).
- **UI:** the deploy wizard shows a loading line instead of "no templates" while the catalog loads ([#226](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/226)).
- **UI:** status badges, the wizard review (Offering, Deploy, GPU / host-device) and the PT `vks.form.offering` are translated; a test checks pt/en key parity ([#227](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/227)).

### Changed

- Dependency updates: Go modules (gRPC 1.84, zap, viper, x/crypto, KubeVirt client 1.9; the k8s libraries stay on the minor the KubeVirt client is built against), Docker base images, GitHub Actions. CI uses the Go version from `go.mod`.
- Dependabot groups only minor and patch npm updates (majors arrive as separate PRs) and ignores minor/major bumps of single `k8s.io/*` libraries.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- Version alignment with operator, vks and the charts. No code changes since 0.10.0. **The CRDs now come from the `virtfoundry-crds` chart**, so install it before core: see [CRDs and upgrades](https://virtfoundry.github.io/helm-charts/docs/guide/crds/).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- **VKS (Kubernetes clusters)** — gRPC `ClusterService` on cmux `:8080` with a thin REST shim; `GetClusterSummary` for the guest cluster; console create form driven by the version/template catalog, cluster detail page, worker VMs on the Nodes tab, Workloads tab; control plane defaults to `LoadBalancer`.
- **Node image** — `ghcr.io/virtfoundry/` containerDisk images pass the allowlist; seeded `ubuntu-node-1-36-5` template (digest-pinned).

### Security

- Container images signed with cosign keyless on release.
- CodeQL, Scorecard, Dependabot (grouped monthly) and dependency review.
- RBAC contract test for the API's typed Kubernetes calls.

### Fixed

- Tenant namespaces get the operator ownership labels; backfill touches only those labels, never crashes the API when forbidden, and finds legacy Tenant CRs by `spec.slug`.
- Root credential Secret is recovered on server start.
- Seeded node template pinned to the working containerDisk digest.

### Changed

- CNCF readiness docs and supply-chain checklist updated.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **Realtime / gRPC** — Instance CR informer publishes full VM events; `WatchInstances` stream; UI consumes WS `power_state` for Start/Stop; poll backs off when websocket healthy; query invalidation beyond `vm.*`.
- **CRD-first compute** — isolated Multus networks on deploy; `ssh_key_id` → Instance `sshKeyRefs`; wizard cloud-init persisted; single actuator under `operatorReconcile`.
- **gRPC spike** — `InstanceService` behind cmux on `:8080`.
- **UI** — deploy wizard network cards/auto-pick, post-deploy IP/SSH/console CTAs, actions menu / template cards / tenant switcher, onboarding network step, OverflowMenu portal fix, clipboard `execCommand` fallback for one-time secrets (Weslei).

### Security

- SSH private PEM treated as one-time secret (names-only thereafter).
- CORS OPTIONS preflight on mux method-mismatch routes.
- HTTP timeouts, body limits, log tail caps.
- ContainerDisk image allowlist on deploy; events/console ticket hardening; autopermission fail-open closed.
- Platform-owned label stamped on Offerings (coordinates operator dedicatedCPU gate).

### Fixed

- Cold-path latency on `/api-keys` / snapshots (N+1 hydration, scoped lists, JWT user by username).
- Unique Network CR names per VPC; refuse delete of default VPC subnet.
- Honest List/Sync under `operatorReconcile`; CI digest write-back auth.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **UI day-2 polish** — deploy wizard em steps (compute → disco → rede → acesso → review), feedback de progresso no deploy, pré-checagens, Activity/Retry em Error, filtros por estado, confirm delete com digitar nome.
- **Operação na lista/detalhe** — ⌘K (command palette), clone (“Deploy like this”), bulk start/stop/delete, tags/pin/favorites (local), split view, gallery de templates, SSH one-liner, rename de display name sem Stopped, error catalog, onboarding checklist no dashboard, banner de impersonate (root), export CSV, tema “seguir sistema”.
- **Cloud-init editor local** na VM (validação YAML leve + secrets mascarados; não aplica no guest sem API).

### Fixed

- Select de chave SSH no wizard não mostra `()` quando `fingerprint` vem vazio.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **VM deploy shows Error / 0 vCPU after operator 0.7.2** — Instance CRs written by the API for pod-network (or CR-first without Multus `spec.nics`) now set `virtfoundry.io/allow-pod-network=true`, matching the operator opt-in. `ListVMs` / `SyncAllVMStates` enrich CPU/memory/template from Offering/Template refs so the UI no longer shows `0 vCPU / 0 MiB` when the Instance status has no sizing fields (background sync no longer overwrites the list cache without enrichment).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-09-25

Security release: cumulative product-security audit fixes since 0.7.1 (SSH defaults, console tickets, JWT/root secrets, CORS/WS Origin, ISO allowlist, CDI importer egress, non-root images, http(s) template→ISO).

### Security (BREAKING)

- **Do not default Linux guest SSH password to `ubuntu`** (issue [#97](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/97))
  - `BuildLinuxUserData` no longer invents `password: ubuntu` with `ssh_pwauth: true` and NOPASSWD sudo when no SSH keys are provided. Linux cloud-init requires an SSH public key **or** an explicit one-time password; otherwise create fails with a clear `400`.
  - Password SSH (`ssh_pwauth`) is enabled only when `cloud_init_password` is supplied on deploy (or an explicit `vm.default_password` / `VIRTFOUNDRY_VM_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` is configured for seed templates). SSH-key-only deploys keep `ssh_pwauth: false` and `lock_passwd: true`.
  - Seeded `ubuntu-2204` templates no longer bake a published default password. On startup, catalog seed strips historical `password: ubuntu` user-data from that template.
  - UI: SSH key is required for Linux VM create. API: optional `cloud_init_password` for lab/automation paths that cannot use keys.
  - Deploys that supply an SSH key or one-time password use the hypervisor cloud-init path (Instance CR does not yet carry `sshKeyRefs`).

### Security

- **UI/API images run non-root** (coordinates [helm-charts#42](https://github.com/virtfoundry/helm-charts/issues/42))
  - UI nginx listens on **8080** (was 80) with an unprivileged main config and `USER nginx`. Helm Service stays `80→8080`.
  - API image runs as UID `65532` (`nonroot`). Chart pod `securityContext` must match.
- **CDI importer egress NetworkPolicy in each tenant namespace** (follow-up to [#95](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/95) / [helm-charts#49](https://github.com/virtfoundry/helm-charts/issues/49))
  - `EnsureTenantNamespace` creates/updates `virtfoundry-cdi-importer-egress`, selecting CDI pods labeled `cdi.kubevirt.io=importer`. DNS to kube-dns/CoreDNS is allowed; egress to `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` excludes private / link-local / CGNAT ranges so DNS rebinding of an allowlisted ISO host cannot reach cluster-internal or metadata addresses over the pod network.
  - Existing tenants pick up the policy on API bootstrap (`EnsureTenant` / `BootstrapDefaultSecurityGroups`) without recreating the tenant record.
  - Docs: [VM-TEMPLATES.md](docs/VM-TEMPLATES.md#cdi-importer-egress-networkpolicy). Chart docs and operator notes live in helm-charts.

### Security (BREAKING)

- **VNC console requires `vms:console` and no longer accepts a JWT in the URL** (issue [#94](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/94))
  - `/ws/console` is mounted behind `RequirePermission(vms:console)`. A tenant viewer holding only `vms:read` can no longer open an interactive console; `tenant.operator` and `tenant.admin` still can. Cross-tenant access is unchanged — the VM is resolved inside the caller's own tenant.
  - New `POST /api/v1/vms/{name}/console-ticket` returns a single-use ticket that expires in 30 seconds and is bound to one VM and tenant. The browser opens `wss://…/ws/console?ticket=…`, so a long-lived JWT never reaches access logs, reverse-proxy logs or browser history. The endpoint is authorized on `vms:console` alone, so a custom role can grant console access without `vms:write`.
  - Credentials are read from headers only (`Authorization`, `X-API-Key`). The previous `?token=` fallback is gone from the REST API and from `/ws/console`. It remains on `/ws/events`, which has no ticket handshake and where a browser cannot set headers.
  - Clients that relied on `?token=` for REST calls or for the console must move to the `Authorization` header or to the ticket handshake.

- **Refuse to start with default `JWT_SECRET` or `ROOT_PASSWORD`** (issue [#93](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/93))
  - `JWT_SECRET` must be provided via env / Kubernetes Secret: empty, shorter than 32 characters, or equal to the historical defaults (`change-me-in-production`, `dev-secret-change-in-prod`) cause the server to exit non-zero with a clear error.
  - `ROOT_PASSWORD` is enforced only when set via env / Kubernetes Secret: at least 12 characters and not the historical default `virtfoundry` (case-insensitive).
  - An **empty** `ROOT_PASSWORD` is accepted. On a brand-new install with no root user in the store, the server generates a strong one-time password, bootstraps the root user with it, and logs it once at startup as a `WARN` — capture it from the boot log; it is not persisted in plaintext. On subsequent boots with the same empty env, the existing root hash is kept (no rotation).
  - Dev-only escape hatch: `VF_ALLOW_INSECURE_DEFAULTS=1` opts out of both checks (prints a `WARN` at startup). Never use this in production. Not exposed via the YAML config file.
  - `docker/Dockerfile` no longer bakes `config/config.yaml.example` into the image; the Helm chart (`virtfoundry/helm-charts`) must mount or render the config (tracked separately).
  - MINOR bump for 0.x per [RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md).

### Security

- **Restrict CORS and pin console WebSocket Origin** (issue [#98](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/98))
  - API CORS no longer emits `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Responses reflect only the request host (same-origin UI proxy) or an origin listed in `security.allowed_origins` / `VIRTFOUNDRY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Cross-origin preflight from a disallowed origin is `403`.
  - `/ws/console` overrides the KubeVirt upgrader's allow-all `CheckOrigin` with the same allowlist already used by `/ws/events` (ticket auth from [#94](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/94) / [#111](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/pull/111) made this safe).
  - UI nginx (`docker/nginx-ui.conf`) adds `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` without changing `/api/` or `/ws/` proxy behaviour.

- **Allowlist ISO HTTP import URLs** (issue [#95](https://github.com/virtfoundry/core/issues/95))
  - A tenant-supplied ISO URL used to become `spec.source.http.url` verbatim, so `vms:write` was enough to make the in-cluster CDI importer fetch cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`), in-cluster services (`https://kubernetes.default.svc`), the node, or any RFC1918 host.
  - ISO URLs now require `https` on port 443, must not embed credentials, and may not target loopback, link-local, private/shared/reserved ranges (including their NAT64 re-encoding) or internal names (`*.svc`, `*.local`, `*.internal`, `*.localdomain`, `*.home.arpa`, single labels). Rejected URLs answer `400` and nothing is persisted.
  - The host must also be on an allowlist: `security.iso_import.allowed_hosts` (or `VIRTFOUNDRY_ISO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`), defaulting to the public ISO mirrors and object storage endpoints documented in [docs/VM-TEMPLATES.md](docs/VM-TEMPLATES.md#allowed-iso-urls). `security.iso_import.disable_http_import` (or `VIRTFOUNDRY_ISO_DISABLE_HTTP_IMPORT=1`) refuses URL imports entirely; `iso_volume_id` still works.
  - Defense in depth: `CreateHTTPImportDataVolume` re-checks the target, so no caller can reach CDI with a private or in-cluster URL.

### Changed

- `cmd/server` exits with a clear error on YAML load failure (was: silent fallback to defaults).
- `config/config.yaml.example` documents the env requirement instead of carrying a placeholder `jwt_secret`.
- `config/README.md` local-dev example uses `openssl rand -base64` to mint `JWT_SECRET` / `ROOT_PASSWORD`.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- VM create image list hides the platform Windows ISO until the tenant uploads an ISO (CDI import ready)

### Changed

- Homelab validated: API + operator + UI without MySQL/worker pods

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-16

Pre-1.0 release line (project is **not** SemVer 1.0). Premature `v1.0.0`–`v1.5.0` tags/releases were deleted in the 2026-09-27 version cleanup; their shipped features are recorded here under `0.5.0`. UI/Helm advertise `0.5.0`.

### Added (absorbed from deleted premature 1.x line)

- IAM: users, roles, API keys (`vfd_live_...`), permission middleware, tenant admin bootstrap, `/iam` UI
- Default VPC per tenant; self-service API keys; volumes attach/detach; service offerings CRUD; template catalog + ISO import; root delete-tenant; dedicated CPU offerings; Features guide
